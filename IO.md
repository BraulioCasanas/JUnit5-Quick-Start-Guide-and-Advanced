Introduction

### Intentions
TODO

For source code see my GitHub-Repository:  
[**dmitrij-drandarov/JUnit-5-QuickStart-Guide-and-Samples**
](https://github.com/dmitrij-drandarov/JUnit-5-QuickStart-Guide-and-Samples)

### Set-Up
For an IDE I recommend *IntelliJ IDEA 2016.2(+)* right now since it brings native support for JUnit 5.  
As for dependencies:

*Maven*
```xml
  <dependency>
        <groupId>org.junit.jupiter</groupId>
        <artifactId>junit-jupiter-api</artifactId>
        <version>5.0.0-M1</version>
        <scope>compile</scope>
  </dependency>
```
```xml
  <dependency>
        <groupId>org.junit.platform</groupId>
        <artifactId>junit-platform-runner</artifactId>
        <version>1.0.0-M1</version>
        <scope>compile</scope>
  </dependency>
```
```xml
  <dependency>
        <groupId>org.junit.jupiter</groupId>
        <artifactId>junit-jupiter-engine</artifactId>
        <version>5.0.0-M1</version>
        <scope>runtime</scope>
  </dependency>
```

*Gradle*
```gradle
  testCompile group: 'org.junit.jupiter', name: 'junit-jupiter-api', version: '5.0.0-M1'Â´
```
```gradle
  testCompile group: 'org.junit.platform', name: 'junit-platform-runner', version: '1.0.0-M1'
```
```gradle
  testRuntime group: 'org.junit.jupiter', name: 'junit-jupiter-engine', version: '5.0.0-M1'
```


General changes [(code)](/src/test/java/com/drandarov/junit5/JUnit5_00_GeneralChanges.java)
------------------------
This paragraph contains the small or general changes made in the transition from JUnit 4 to JUnit 5. Those are simple
but still note worthy.

The first change is made to the most basic of things: the test and the `@Test`-annotation themselves. You no longer 
need to make the test `public`, however you can still not make it `static` or `private`. Also timeout and expected 
parameter functionality has moved elsewhere.

![img/00_simple_test.png](img/00_simple_test.png)

Other annotations have received slight changes as well, including the common `@BeforeClass`, `@BeforeEach`, their
`@After...` aequivalents, `@Ignored` and the lesser known `@Category`. All of these have been renamed and given the
same treatment regarding public as `@Test`.

![img/01_other_annotations.png](img/01_other_annotations.png)

`Assert` and `Assume` classes have been renamed as well and are now called `Assertions` and `Assumptions`. Not much has
changed for the naming of the methods of both classes.

New features: Basics [(code)](/src/test/java/com/drandarov/junit5/JUnit5_01_NewFeaturesBasics.java)
-----------------------------

### General
Here I want to introduce some basics for the new features available in the new version.  
There is a new pretty annotation called `@DisplayName` which is supposed to improve the readability of test reports, so
you don't need 40-character test-names to make clear what the test is about at a glance.

### Labda-Support
Now for the probably most known and anticipated feature in JUnit 5: Lambda-Support...  
JUnit 5 `Assertions` and `Assumptions` classes and its methods now provide Lambda support. This is achieved by providing
methods with functional interfaces as parameters.

The most used ones are the `BooleanSupplier` and `Supplier<String>`. The first one is used for assertions and the latter
one to provide a result-message. Those are however just alternatives to the older plain `boolean` and `String`.  
Assertion methods like `assertTrue(...)` are now just overloaded with combinations of those four parameters:  
`boolean` OR `BooleanSupplier` X `String` OR `Supplier<String>` resulting in four different methods.

![img/05_assertSupplier.png](img/05_assertSupplier.png)

A new important functional interface is `Executable`. It is very similar to a `Runnable`, however it throws a
`Throwable` meaning you can execute assertions like `assertTrue()` and an `AssertionError` may be thrown affecting your
test-result. It is used in several assertions like the new `assertAll(Executable... executables)` which can be also used
to prevent repitition.

### Parameter Resolver

The biggest new feature in JUnit 5 is the new Extension-API. A part of it is the `ParameterResolver`-Interface which is
an extension of the `Extension`-Interface itself. The `ParameterResolver`-Interface provide a way for dependency
injection on method level by injecting data into test-method parameters.  
JUnit 5 provides two implementations by itself: `TestInfo` which contains some meta information and the appropriate
Test-`Method` and Test-`Class` instances and `TestReporter` which can be used to publish test entries.  
A lot more on the Extension-Api is following further below.

New features: Advanced [(code)](/src/test/java/com/drandarov/junit5/JUnit5_02_NewFeaturesAdvanced.java)
-------------------------------

### Test-Parameters
Building upon the `ParameterResolver` paragraph of the last chapter let's look at implementing your own
`ParameterResolver`. You can also see the first visual sign of the Extension-API in the form of the
`@ExtendWith`-Annotation. The final result is:

![img/09_parameterResolverExt.png](img/09_parameterResolverExt.png)

This is achieved by the following implementations:

The first implementation processes the `String` parameter `className`. It checks whether the parameter class is a
`String` and throws an exception otherwise. To resolve and inject the parameter it just returns the test classes name.

![img/10_parameterClassName.png](img/10_parameterClassName.png)

The seconds implementation processes the `Long` parameter `parameterIndex`. It does basically the same but resolves the
parameter by getting the index from the `parameterContext`.
